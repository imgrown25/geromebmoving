Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text<br>
 of the printing and typesetting industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s</i>, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<u> It has survived not only five centuries</u>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
<hr>
 It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
